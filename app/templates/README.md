# Generator Studio Hooks Template

This is the template code used by our bespoke Yeoman code generator - [Generator Studio Hooks](https://github.com/bushers/generator-studio-hooks)

This code will be generated when a new project is created.

In order to keep the generator up to date, it is important that any updates here are also reflected in the main generator repo (Github link above), in the folder `app/templates`.

**Note:** When copying over this code, do not copy this readme file as this relates to this repo and not instructions on using the generator itself.
